# Plan to Push to Production
#repo #github #gitactions 

* ***Development**
	- two webservers with one file share attached. (file share A)
* ***Production**
	- two webservers with one file share attached. (file share B)

So if we use the runner on Development or Production it will have to share between these to so no matter where the runner is we will have to Push from one share to the other. We first have to make sure that which ever one we do has a share to both of the file shares so it can be done.
