We really like how the tool is shaping up. We went through the tool and made notes of a few additions and modifications.

The system kept freezing in dev and production mode, and I think I noticed inconsistencies between them (which makes sense).

I’m attaching an updated template to showcase changes to Places and Things sections and a CSV file.

Additions, please add:

-   Print button
-   Download button
-   View plan button (where it is now, is not really intuitive)

Modifications, please change:

-   In Things, please remove equipment and Just In Time reminders. There instead should be a section for each.
-   In Things, I’d like the text headers for the fillable fields to say the following

-   Critical Applications and Records
-   Alternatives to Critical Applications and Records
-   Communications Tools
-   Alternatives to Communications Tools
-   Equipment
-   Alternate Equipment

-   For Places, the fields should be titled Primary Location and Alternate Location _(I can’t recall if it’s like that already)_
-   For section headers (for People, Places, and Things) it says the department’s name. I’d like the section header to align with the section. For instance, when you click People, People should be the header for the next page.
