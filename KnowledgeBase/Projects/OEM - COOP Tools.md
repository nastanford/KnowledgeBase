## My Items
- [x] Leadership Succession - Update column name position to title - Sent to dba's
- [x] Essential Processes - Add Table for Time Sensitivity - Sent to dba's

## Action Items
### Essential Process: 
1.  [x]  Replace “Leadership Succession Table” with “Essential Processes”
2.  [x]  Typo under Continuity Strategies, “preforms” should be “performs”
3.   [ ] Time-sensitivity should be a drop down….is it already? If not, please add as options: Immediately, Within a few days, Within a couple week, and In a month or more. (Done on Development but waiting for insert permissions on Production.)
- [ ] i. Dropdown should be applied (or auto-populated) for time-sensitivity in Essential Job Aids too.

### Essential Process Job Aids: **Authorities**

1.  [ ] Replace “authorities” with “responsibilities and authorities” and amend the text language to describe authorities and responsibilities when performing this process.
2.  [ ] Add “limitations” and put text language that says: “describe limitations of responsibilities and authorities for backup personnel.”

### Essential Process Job Aids: **Continuity of Resources**

1.  [ ] There should be three areas within this section along with the text

 - [ ]  i.  Critical Applications & Vital Records: Applications and records that are needed and describe strategies to safeguard and preserve them i.e., cloud-based services, manual workarounds, hard copies etc

 -  [ ] ii. Communication Resources: Comms. resources needed and strategies for redundancy or safeguarding.

-  [ ] iii. Equipment: What equipment or resource is needed and describes strategies to safeguard its availability.

### Essential Process Job Aids: **Process description**

 - [ ] 1.  Remove the second “process description” listed underneath “instructions or procedures…”

### Safeguard of critical applications and vital records

- [ ]  1.  It should state the first two sentences as text but add a fillable box for this section.
- [ ] 2.  This is a standalone section (not related to Additional Information)

### Additional Information

- [ ] 1.  This is an optional section and should not appear if “additional information” is not attached/uploaded to the plan
- [ ] 2.  This section allow depts to add attachments to their plan, for example: contact lists, standard operating procedures etc.

### Laura Notes
- [ ] 1.  Hayley, I think the Concept of Operations section needs a section that makes it clear who is doing what and how the differentiation between those sections are determined. I would struggle to implement the plan if I were department continuity personnel. It should probably be in a format like if this then this, sort of like our duty officer checklists.
- [ ] 2.  Nathan, I don’t think the Contact Roster table should be called “Leadership Succession Table”, perhaps “Contacts Roster”. I’d like to see a column in that table that specifies the role the person has in the plan (e.g. Primary Essential Process 1, Secondary Essential Process 3, etc. ).



### List
- Leadership Succession
- Essential Processes
- Essential Processes Job Aids
    - Safeguard of Critical Applications and Vital Records
- Contact Roster
- Additional Information (Attached Documents)
